It forces complexity and mixed state handling on the endpoint implementation. It has to both determine if OP A was extant and is now complete, then it has to follow on and do dependent OP B. Mixed state handling can require that  single instance has access to two differently provisioned and permissioned data stores.\r\n2. It forces the same authorization & authentication model on both OP A and OP B. (I will raise a seperate issue for another concerne regading the authentication SHOULD for Resolve Receipt)\r\n3. Implementors will likely want different rate limits for those actions. Checking if an extant operation is complete is light weight and can be designed for \"polling clients\". Producing a receipts, potentially finalising registration, could be a much heavier load. I would want the ability to seperately rate limit that request.\r\n\r\n\r\nI very much prefered the previous draft's approach of having a distinct endpoint on which to check for the completion of async registration",

We're following RFC 9290 and that deviated. Note that 9290 is ordinally between 7807 and 9457 so maybe there's an update that needs to happen there.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 legit options and I think both have their own unique charm. One is to follow 9290, which I showed above. The other would be to exploit Appendix C of 9457.\r\n\r\nI considered the latter and it's easy enough to do, I was just trying to favour the documents from the CBOR stable. \r\nThe slightly grotty thing about the 9457 route is that we can't use any of the defined CBOR tags so it ends up just being what Pythonistas would call 'derisory dictionary programming' with uncompressed string keys. But we're not CoAP so who cares?\r\n\r\nGiven the explanation, any strong opinion on those routes?",

I spoke to one of the CBOR authors and they include the status code in the object is for extra later clues to errors (poring over log files for example) but I agree it's a bit of a violation.

However, can the server return a guaranteed unique ID? The client submitting a unique ID is part of the idempotent design pattern.\r\n\r\nSome background on idempotent patterns\r\n- [IETF Draft: The Idempotency-Key HTTP Header Field](https://ietf-wg-httpapi.github.io/idempotency/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header.html)\r\n- [Life beyond Distributed Transactions](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3025012)\r\n- [Reducing client complexity with idempotent API design](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/)\r\n- [Idempotent REST API](https://restfulapi.net/idempotent-rest-apis/)\r\n\r\nDo we need a request ID (`Idempotency-Key`)?\r\n1. If the client makes a registration request and fails to get a response, the client is unsure if the registration was received, the response failed, or the request was never received.\r\n1. The client would try again, which could generate multiple registrations\r\n\r\nIn an idempotent world, the server would check if the request was previously made and, if so, return the same response.\r\nThe issue is that a client could be intentionally making a secondary registration because the registration policy may have changed or the client needs a new registration for a new point in time.\r\n\r\n- Do we need to support multiple registrations of the same signed statement from the same issuer? \r\n  - Yes, as client may be registering, knowing a new registration policy has been set, or they simply need a new registered timestamp.  If the client wishes to register the same signed statement multiple times, they would generate a unique `Idempotency-Key`\r\n- Can the server specify a window of time (which is implementation-specific) by which it treats them as idempotent? \r\n  - Yes, and [Section 2.3. Idempotency Key Validity and Expiry](https://ietf-wg-httpapi.github.io/idempotency/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header.html#name-idempotency-key-validity-an) supports the scenario. If the client submits a second registration, and the server purged the `Idempotency-Key`, the \"duplicate request\" would generate a duplicate entry\r\n- How short should validity window be?\r\n  - This is likely a new issue, with a SHOULD that would hopefully represent weeks or months, if not years. \r\n\r\nSeparately, a discussion to support success/failure response codes for failed registration vs. \"not found\" is needed.

However, can the server return a guaranteed unique ID? The client submitting a unique ID is part of the idempotent design pattern.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the `request_id` in Commit 4 came out of the discussion in the prior editors' call where a couple of people asked for some kind of a correlation ID that the client could use to keep its own track of the LROs it was checking and receiving. Various use cases were mooted all along the lines that contexts may be confused (in the case of connection pooling or similar at the client end) or lost (in the case of one end or other crashing).\r\n\r\nThis seemed reasonable to try to accommodate and I did it to show how it might look, but actually I don't like how it's turned out and would gladly revert. Reasons:\r\n - Having the operation ID and request/correlation ID was redundant...unless we also enabled LIST on /operations which doesn't seem terribly sensible. That's why I removed the server-generated ID from the resource path.\r\n - Inserting the optional request ID into the POST required us to throw it in the unprotected header, which feels grotty\r\n\r\n> In an idempotent world, the server would check if the request was previously made and, if so, return the same response. The issue is that a client could be intentionally making a secondary registration because the registration policy may have changed or the client needs a new registration for a new point in time.\r\n\r\nI like the idempotency key stuff and we should look into it but I think it's a reasonable and coherent v1 to just say that EVERY POST is a new registration and starts a new registration operation for a new receipt. We can't legislate for software bugs or try to guess the intention of the client.\r\n\r\n> Separately, a discussion to support success/failure response codes for failed registration vs. \"not found\" is needed.\r\n\r\nAgreed. That's already on the list.",

The ability to set request_id in the registration request is unnecessary and may be confusing.   I would also suggest to rename request_id to registration_id to make it clear that it is the identifier picked by the server when the registration is accepted",
