1.  Introduction

   The SCITT Architecture [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture] defines
   the core operations necessary to support supply chain transparency
   using COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption).

   *  Issuance of Signed Statements

   *  Verification of Signed Statements

   *  Registration of Signed Statements

   *  Issuance of Receipts

   *  Verification of Receipts

   *  Production of Transparent Statements

   *  Verification of Transparent Statements

   In addition to defining concrete HTTP endpoints for these operations,
   this specification defines support for the following endpoints which
   support these operations:

   *  Resolving Verification Keys for Issuers

   *  Retrieving Receipts Asynchronously

   *  Retrieving Signed Statements from an Artifact Repository

   *  Retrieving Statements from an Artifact Repository

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "Signed Statement", "Receipt",
   "Transparent Statement", "Artifact Repositories", "Transparency
   Service", "Append-Only Log" and "Registration Policy" as defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture].

   This specification uses "payload" as defined in [RFC9052].

2.  Endpoints

   Authentication is out of scope for this document.  If Authentication
   is not implemented, rate limiting or other denial of service
   mitigations MUST be applied to enable anonymous access.

   NOTE: '' line wrapping per [RFC8792] in HTTP examples.

   All messages are sent as HTTP GET or POST requests.

   If the Transparency Service cannot process a client's request, it
   MUST return an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code, and the body SHOULD be a
   JSON problem details object ([RFC9457]) containing:

   *  type: A URI reference identifying the problem.  To facilitate
      automated response to errors, this document defines a set of
      standard tokens for use in the type field within the URN namespace
      of: "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error:".

   *  detail: A human-readable string describing the error that
      prevented the Transparency Service from processing the request,
      ideally with sufficient detail to enable the error to be
      rectified.

   Error responses SHOULD be sent with the Content-Type: application/
   problem+json HTTP header.

   As an example, submitting a Signed Statement with an unsupported
   signature algorithm would return a 400 Bad Request status code and
   the following body:

   {
     "type": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error:badSignatureAlgorithm",
     "detail": "Signing algorithm not support"
   }

   Most error types are specific to the type of request and are defined
   in the respective subsections below.  The one exception is the
   "malformed" error type, which indicates that the Transparency Service
   could not parse the client's request because it did not comply with
   this document:

   *  Error code: malformed (The request could not be parsed).

   Clients SHOULD treat 500 and 503 HTTP status code responses as
   transient failures and MAY retry the same request without
   modification at a later date.  Note that in the case of a 503
   response, the Transparency Service MAY include a Retry-After header
   field per [RFC9110] in order to request a minimum time for the client
   to wait before retrying the request.  In the absence of this header
   field, this document does not specify a minimum.

2.1.  Mandatory

   The following HTTP endpoints are mandatory to implement to enable
   conformance to this specification.

2.1.1.  Transparency Configuration

   Authentication SHOULD NOT be implemented for this endpoint.  This
   endpoint is used to discovery the capabilities of a transparency
   service implementing this specification.

   Request:

   GET /.well-known/transparency-configuration HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/json

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "issuer": "https://transparency.example",
     "registration_endpoint": "https://transparency.example/entries",
     "nonce_endpoint": "https://transparency.example/nonce",

     "registration_policy": \
   "https://transparency.example\
   /statements/urn:ietf:params:scitt:statement\
   :sha-256:base64url:5i6UeRzg1...qnGmr1o",

     "supported_signature_algorithms": ["ES256"],
     "jwks": {
       "keys": [
         {
           "kid": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:\
   jwk-thumbprint:sha-256:DgyowWs04gfVRim5i1WlQ-HFFFKI6Ltqulj1rXPagRo",
           "alg": "ES256",
           "use": "sig",
           "kty": "EC",
           "crv": "P-256",
           "x": "p-kZ4uOASt9IjQRTrWikGnlbGb-z3LU1ltwRjZaOS9w",
           "y": "ymXE1yltJPXgjQSRe9NweN3TLlSUALYZTzy83NVfdg0"
         },
         {
           "kid": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:\
   jwk-thumbprint:sha-256:4Fzx5HO1W0ob9CZNc3RJx28Ixpgy9JAFM8jyXKW0ClE",
           "alg": "HPKE-Base-P256-SHA256-AES128GCM",
           "use": "enc",
           "kty": "EC",
           "crv": "P-256",
           "x": "Vreuil95vzR6ixutgBBf2ota-rj97MvKfuJWB4qqp5w",
           "y": "NkUTeaoNlLRRsVRxHGDA-RsA0ex2tSpcd3G-4SmKXbs"
         }
       ]
     }
   }

   Additional fields may be present.  Fields that are not understood
   MUST be ignored.

2.1.2.  Register Signed Statement

   Authentication MAY be implemented for this endpoint.  See notes on
   detached payloads below.

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request to
   register a Signed Statement:

   Request:

   POST /entries HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/json
   Content-Type: application/cose
   Payload (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   18([                            / COSE Sign1         /
     h'a1013822',                  / Protected Header   /
     {},                           / Unprotected Header /
     null,                         / Detached Payload   /
     h'269cd68f4211dffc...0dcb29c' / Signature          /
   ])

   The Registration Policy for the Transparency Service MUST be applied
   to the payload bytes, before any additional processing is performed.

   If the payload is detached, the Transparency Service depends on the
   authentication context of the client in the Registration Policy.  If
   the payload is attached, the Transparency Service depends on both the
   authentication context of the client (if present), and the
   verification of the Signed Statement in the Registration Policy.  The
   details of Registration Policy are out of scope for this document.

   If registration succeeds the following identifier MAY be used to
   refer to the Signed Statement that was accepted:

   urn:ietf:params:scitt:signed-statement:sha-
   256:base64url:5i6UeRzg1...qnGmr1o

   If the payload was attached, or otherwise communicated to the
   Transparency Service, the following identifier MAY be used to refer
   to the payload of the Signed Statement:

   urn:ietf:params:scitt:statement:sha-256:base64url:5i6UeRzg1...qnGmr1o

   Response:

   One of the following:

2.1.2.1.  Status 201 - Registration is successful

   HTTP/1.1 201 Ok

   Location: https://transparency.example/receipts\
   /urn:ietf:params:scitt:signed-statement\
   :sha-256:base64url:5i6UeRzg1...qnGmr1o

   Content-Type: application/cose

   Payload (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   18([                            / COSE Sign1         /
     h'a1013822',                  / Protected Header   /
     {},                           / Unprotected Header /
     null,                         / Detached Payload   /
     h'269cd68f4211dffc...0dcb29c' / Signature          /
   ])

   The response contains the Receipt for the Signed Statement.  Fresh
   receipts may be requested through the resource identified in the
   Location header.

2.1.2.2.  Status 202 - Registration is running

   HTTP/1.1 202 Ok

   Location: https://transparency.example/receipts\
   /urn:ietf:params:scitt:signed-statement\
   :sha-256:base64url:5i6UeRzg1...qnGmr1o

   Content-Type: application/json
   Retry-After: <seconds>

   {

     "receipt": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:receipt\
   :sha-256:base64url:5i6UeRzg1...qnGmr1o",

   }

   The response contains a reference to the receipt which will
   eventually be available for the Signed Statement.

   If 202 is returned, then clients should wait until Registration
   succeeded or failed by polling the receipt endpoint using the receipt
   identifier returned in the response.

2.1.2.3.  Status 400 - Invalid Client Request

   One of the following errors:

   {
     "type": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error\
   :signed-statement:algorithm-not-supported",
     "detail": \
   "Signed Statement contained an algorithm that is not supported."
   }

   {
     "type": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error\
   :signed-statement:payload-missing",
     "detail": \
   "Signed Statement payload must be attached (must be present)"
   }

   {
     "type": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error\
   :signed-statement:payload-forbidden",
     "detail": \
   "Signed Statement payload must be detached (must not be present)"
   }

   {
     "type": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error\
   :signed-statement:rejected-by-registration-policy",
     "detail": \
   "Signed Statement not accepted by the current Registration Policy"
   }

   {
     "type": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:error\
   :signed-statement:confirmation-missing",
     "detail": \
   "Signed Statement did not contain proof of possession"
   }

   TODO: other error codes

2.2.  Optional Endpoints

   The following HTTP endpoints are optional to implement.

2.2.1.  Issue Signed Statement

   Authentication MUST be implemented for this endpoint.

   This endpoint enables a Transparency Service to be an issuer of
   Signed Statements on behalf of authenticated clients.  This supports
   cases where a client lacks the ability to perform complex
   cryptographic operations, but can be authenticated and report
   statements and measurements.

   Request:

   POST /signed-statements/issue HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/json
   Content-Type: application/vc+ld+json
   Payload

   {
     "@context": [
       "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
       "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
     ],
     "id": "https://transparency.example/credentials/1872",
     "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "SensorCredential"],
     "issuer": "https://transparency.example/device/1234",
     "validFrom": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
     "credentialSubject": {
       "type": "Feature",
       "geometry": {
         "type": "Point",
         "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1]
       },
       "properties": {
         "name": "Dinagat Islands"
       }
     }
   }

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Payload (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   18([                            / COSE Sign1         /
     h'a1013822',                  / Protected Header   /
     {},                           / Unprotected Header /
     null,                         / Detached Payload   /
     h'269cd68f4211dffc...0dcb29c' / Signature          /
   ])

2.2.2.  Resolve Statement

   Authentication SHOULD be implemented for this endpoint.

   This endpoint enables Transparency Service APIs to act like Artifact
   Repositories, and serve payload values directly, instead of
   indirectly through Receipts.

   Request:

   GET /statements/urn...qnGmr1o HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/pdf

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
   Content-Type: application/pdf
   Payload (pdf bytes)

2.2.3.  Resolve Signed Statement

   Authentication SHOULD be implemented for this endpoint.

   This endpoint enables Transparency Service APIs to act like Artifact
   Repositories, and serve Signed Statements directly, instead of
   indirectly through Receipts.

   Request:

   GET /signed-statements/urn...qnGmr1o HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cose

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Payload (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   18([                            / COSE Sign1         /
     h'a1013822',                  / Protected Header   /
     {},                           / Unprotected Header /
     null,                         / Detached Payload   /
     h'269cd68f4211dffc...0dcb29c' / Signature          /
   ])

2.2.4.  Resolve Receipt

   Authentication SHOULD be implemented for this endpoint.

   Request:

   GET /receipts/urn...qnGmr1o HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cose

   Response:

   If the Signed Statement requested is already included in the Append-
   Only Log:

   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
   Location: https://transparency.example/receipts/urn...qnGmr1o
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Payload (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   18([                            / COSE Sign1         /
     h'a1013822',                  / Protected Header   /
     {},                           / Unprotected Header /
     null,                         / Detached Payload   /
     h'269cd68f4211dffc...0dcb29c' / Signature          /
   ])

   If the Signed Statement requested is not yet included in the Append-
   Only Log:

   HTTP/1.1 202 Ok
   Location: https://transparency.example/receipts/urn...qnGmr1o
   Content-Type: application/json
   Retry-After: <seconds>

   {
     "receipt": "urn:ietf:params:scitt:receipt\
       :sha-256:base64url:5i6UeRzg1...qnGmr1o",
   }

   Additional eventually consistent operation details MAY be present.
   Support for eventually consistent Receipts is implementation
   specific, and out of scope for this specification.

2.2.5.  Resolve Issuer

   This endpoint is inspired by [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc].
   Authentication SHOULD NOT be implemented for this endpoint.  This
   endpoint is used to discover verification keys, which is the reason
   that authentication is not required.

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the
   Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://transparency.example/tenant/1234:

   Request:

   GET /.well-known/issuer/tenant/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/json

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "issuer": "https://transparency.example/tenant/1234",
     "jwks": {
       "keys": [
         {
           "kid": "urn:ietf:params:oauth\
   :jwk-thumbprint:sha-256:DgyowWs04gfVRim5i1WlQ-HFFFKI6Ltqulj1rXPagRo",
           "alg": "ES256",
           "use": "sig",
           "kty": "EC",
           "crv": "P-256",
           "x": "p-kZ4uOASt9IjQRTrWikGnlbGb-z3LU1ltwRjZaOS9w",
           "y": "ymXE1yltJPXgjQSRe9NweN3TLlSUALYZTzy83NVfdg0"
         },
         {
           "kid": "urn:ietf:params:oauth\
   :jwk-thumbprint:sha-256:4Fzx5HO1W0ob9CZNc3RJx28Ixpgy9JAFM8jyXKW0ClE",
           "alg": "HPKE-Base-P256-SHA256-AES128GCM",
           "use": "enc",
           "kty": "EC",
           "crv": "P-256",
           "x": "Vreuil95vzR6ixutgBBf2ota-rj97MvKfuJWB4qqp5w",
           "y": "NkUTeaoNlLRRsVRxHGDA-RsA0ex2tSpcd3G-4SmKXbs"
         }
       ]
     }
   }

2.2.6.  Request Nonce

   This endpoint in inspired by
   [I-D.draft-demarco-oauth-nonce-endpoint].

   Authentication SHOULD NOT be implemented for this endpoint.  This
   endpoint is used to demonstrate proof of possession, which is the
   reason that authentication is not required.  Client holding signed
   statements that require demonstrating proof of possession MUST use
   this endpoint to obtain a nonce.

   Request:

   GET /nonce HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/json

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "nonce": "d2JhY2NhbG91cmVqdWFuZGFt"
   }

2.2.7.  Resolve Issuer DID

   This endpoint enables the use of the DID Web Decentralized Identifier
   Method, as an alternative expression of the Issuer Metadata endpoint.

   This endpoint is DEPRECATED.

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the
   Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   did:web:transparency.example:tenant:1234:

3.  Privacy Considerations

   TODO

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  General scope

   This document describes the interoperable API for client calls to,
   and implementations of, a Transparency Service as specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture].  As such the security
   considerations in this section are concerned only with security
   considerations that are relevant at that implementation layer.  All
   questions of security of the related COSE formats, algorithm choices,
   cryptographic envelopes,verifiable data structures and the like are
   handled elsewhere and out of scope of this document.

4.2.  Applicable Environment

   SCITT is concerned with issues of cross-boundary supply-chain-wide
   data integrity and as such must assume a very wide range of
   deployment environments.  Thus, no assumptions can be made about the
   security of the computing environment in which any client
   implementation of this specification runs.

4.3.  User-host authentication

   [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture] defines 2 distinct roles that
   require authentication: Issuers who sign Statements, and clients that
   submit API calls on behalf of Issuers.  While Issuer authentication
   and signing of Statements is very important for the trustworthiness
   of systems implementing the SCITT building blocks, it is out of scope
   of this document.  This document is only concerned with
   authentication of API clients.

   For those endpoints that require client authentication, Transparency
   Services MUST support at least one of the following options:

   *  HTTP Authorization header with a bearer JWT

   *  domain-bound API key

   *  TLS client authentication

   Transparency Services MUST provide a configuration surface that
   allows Issuers to specify which authorized clients can submit
   Statements on their behalf.

   Where authentication methods rely on long term secrets, both clients
   and Transparency Services implementing this specification MUST allow
   for the revocation and rolling of authentication secrets.

4.4.  Primary threats

4.4.1.  In scope

   The most serious threats to implementations on Transparency Services
   are ones that would cause the failure of their main promises, to wit:

   *  Threats to strong identification, for example representing the
      Statements from one issuer as those of another

   *  Threats to payload integrity, for example changing the contents of
      a Signed Statement before making it transparent

   *  Threats to non-equivocation, for example attacks that would enable
      the presentation or verification of divergent proofs for the same
      Statement payload

4.4.1.1.  Denial of service attacks

   While denial of service attacks are very hard to defend against
   completely, and Transparency Services are unlikely to be in the
   critical path of any safety-liable operation, any attack which could
   cause the _silent_ failure of Signed Statement registration, for
   example, should be considered in scope.

   In principle DoS attacks are easily mitigated by the client checking
   that the Transparency Service has registered any submitted Signed
   Statement and returned a Receipt.  Since verification of Receipts
   does not require the involvement of the Transparency Service DoS
   attacks are not a major issue.

   Clients to Transparency Services SHOULD ensure that Receipts are
   available for their registered Statements, either on a periodic or
   needs-must basis, depending on the use case.

   Beyond this, implementers of Transparency Services SHOULD implement
   general good practice around network attacks, flooding, rate limiting
   etc.

4.4.1.2.  Eavesdropping

   Since the purpose of this API is to ultimately put the message
   payloads on a Transparency Log there is limited risk to
   eavesdropping.  Nonetheless transparency may mean 'within a limited
   community' rather than 'in full public', so implementers MUST add
   protections against man-in-the-middle and network eavesdropping, such
   as TLS.

4.4.1.3.  Message modification attacks

   While most relevant modification attacks are mitigated by the use of
   the Issuer signature on the Signed Statement, the Issue Statement
   endpoint presents an opportunity for manipulation of messages and
   misrepresentation of Issuer intent that could mislead later
   Verifiers.

   Transparency Services offering the Issue Statement endpoint MUST
   require authentication and transport-level security for that
   endpoint, MUST NOT modify anything in the message to be signed, and
   MUST take steps to ensure that the party calling the endpoint is
   authorized to register statements on behalf of the specified Issuer.

4.4.1.4.  Message insertion attacks

   While most relevant insertion attacks are mitigated by the use of the
   Issuer signature on the Signed Statement, the Issue Statement
   endpoint presents an opportunity for insertion of messages and
   misrepresentation of Issuer intent that could mislead later
   Verifiers.  There are 2 most likely avenues to this attack:

   *  Stolen client endpoint authentication credentials

   *  Stolen or misused Issuer keys held in the Transparency Service on
      behalf of clients

   Clients relying on the Issue Statement endpoint SHOULD take steps to
   ensure their endpoint authentication credentials are securely stored
   and can be rotated and/or revoked in the case of a breach.

   Transparency Services offering the Issue Statement endpoint MUST
   require authentication and transport-level security for that
   endpoint, and MUST enable the rotation and revocation of those
   credentials.

   Transparency Services offering the Issue Statement endpoint MUST take
   careful steps in both design and operation of their software stack to
   prevent the theft or inappropriate use of the Issuer keys they use to
   sign Statements on behalf of Issuers, such as HSMs for storage and
   least-privilege, regularly refreshed access controls for use.

   Transparency Services MAY also implement additional protections such
   as anomaly detection or rate limiting in order to mitigate the impact
   of any breach.

4.4.2.  Out of scope

4.4.2.1.  Replay attacks

   Replay attacks are not particularly concerning for SCITT or SCRAPI:
   once a statement is made, it is intended to be immutable and non-
   repudiable, so making it twice should not lead to any particular
   issues.  There could be issues at the payload level (for instance,
   the statement "it is raining" may true when first submitted but not
   when replayed), but being payload-agnostic implementations of SCITT
   services cannot be required to worry about that.

   If the semantic content of the payload are time dependent and
   susceptible to replay attacks in this way then timestamps MAY be
   added to the payload signed by the Issuer.

4.4.2.2.  Message deletion attacks

   Once registered with a Transparency Service, Registered Signed
   Statements cannot be deleted.  Thus, any message deletion attack must
   occur prior to registration else it is indistinguishable from a man-
   in-the-middle or denial-of-service attack on this interface.

5.   TODO

   TODO: Consider negotiation for receipt as "JSON" or "YAML".  TODO:
