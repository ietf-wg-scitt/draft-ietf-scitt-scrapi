Abstract

   This document describes a REST API that supports the normative
   requirements of the SCITT Architecture.  Optional key discovery and
   query interfaces are provided to support interoperability with X.509
   Certificates, alternative methods commonly used to support public key
   discovery and Artifact Repositories.

1.  Introduction

   The SCITT Architecture [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture] defines
   the core objects, identifiers and workflows necessary to interact
   with a SCITT Transparency Service:

   *  Signed Statements

   *  Receipts

   *  Transparent Statements

   *  Registration Policies

   SCRAPI defines the operations necessary to support supply chain
   transparency using COSE [RFC9052]:

   *  Issuance of Signed Statements

   *  Registration of Signed Statements

   *  Verification of Signed Statements

   *  Issuance of Receipts

   *  Verification of Receipts

   *  Production of Transparent Statements

   *  Verification of Transparent Statements

   In addition to these operational HTTP endpoints, this specification
   defines supporting endpoints:

   *  Resolving Verification Keys for Issuers

   *  Retrieving Receipts Asynchronously

   *  Retrieving Signed Statements from an Artifact Repository

   *  Retrieving Statements from an Artifact Repository

   *  Exchanging Receipts for refreshed Receipts

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "Signed Statement", "Receipt",
   "Transparent Statement", "Artifact Repositories", "Transparency
   Service" and "Registration Policy" as defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture].

   This specification uses "payload" as defined in [RFC9052].

2.  Endpoints

   Authentication is out of scope for this document.  Implementations
   MAY authenticate clients, for example for the purposes of
   authorization or preventing denial of service attacks.  If
   Authentication is not implemented, rate limiting or other denial of
   service mitigation MUST be implemented.

   All messages are sent as HTTP GET or POST requests.

   If the Transparency Service cannot process a client's request, it
   MUST return either:

   1.  an HTTP 3xx code, indicating to the client additional action they
       must take to complete the request, such as follow a redirection,
       or

   2.  an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code, and the body SHOULD be a Concise
       Problem Details object (application/concise-problem-details+cbor)
       [RFC9290] containing:

   *  title: A human-readable string identifying the error that
      prevented the Transparency Service from processing the request,
      ideally short and suitable for inclusion in log messages.

   *  detail: A human-readable string describing the error in more
      depth, ideally with sufficient detail enabling the error to be
      rectified.

   SCRAPI is not a CoAP API, but Constrained Problem Details objects
   [RFC9290] provide a useful encoding for problem details and avoid the
   need to mix CBOR and JSON in endpoint or client implementations.

   NOTE: Examples use '\' line wrapping per [RFC8792]

   Examples of errors may include:

   {
     / title /         -1: \
               "Bad Signature Algorithm",
     / detail /        -2: \
               "Signing algorithm 'WalnutDSA' not supported"
   }

   Most error types are specific to the type of request and are defined
   in the respective subsections below.  The one exception is the
   "malformed" error type, which indicates that the Transparency Service
   could not parse the client's request because it did not comply with
   this document:

   Error code: `malformed` (The request could not be parsed)

   Clients SHOULD treat 500 and 503 HTTP status code responses as
   transient failures and MAY retry the same request without
   modification at a later date.

   Note that in the case of any error response, the Transparency Service
   MAY include a Retry-After header field per [RFC9110] in order to
   request a minimum time for the client to wait before retrying the
   request.  In the absence of this header field, this document does not
   specify a minimum.

2.1.  Mandatory

   The following HTTP endpoints are mandatory to implement to enable
   conformance to this specification.

2.1.1.  Transparency Configuration

   This endpoint is used to discover the capabilities and current
   configuration of a transparency service implementing this
   specification.

   The Transparency Service responds with a CBOR map of configuration
   elements.  These elements are Transparency-Service specific.

   Contents of bodies are informative examples only.

   Request:

   GET /.well-known/transparency-configuration HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cbor

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/cbor

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   {
     "issuer": "https://transparency.example",
     "cose_keys_uri": "https://transparency.example/cose-keys"
   }

   Responses to this message are vendor-specific.  Fields that are not
   understood MUST be ignored.

2.1.2.  Transparency Service Keys

   This endpoint is used to discover the public keys that can be used by
   relying parties to verify Receipts issued by the Transparency
   Service.

   The Transparency Service responds with a COSE Key Set, as defined in
   Section 7 of [RFC9052].

   Request:

   GET /cose-keys HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cbor

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/cbor

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   [
     {
       -1:1,
       -2:h'65eda5a12577c2bae829437fe338701a10aaa375e1bb5b5de108de439c08551d',
       -3:h'1e52ed75701163f7f9e40ddf9f341b3dc9ba860af7e0ca7ca7e9eecd0084d19c',
       1:2,
       2:'kid1'
     },
     {
       -1:1,
       -2:h'bac5b11cad8f99f9c72b05cf4b9e26d244dc189f745228255a219a86d6a09eff',
       -3:h'20138bf82dc1b6d562be0fa54ab7804a3a64b6d72ccfed6b6fb6ed28bbfc117e',
       1:2,
       2:'kid2'
     }
   ]

2.1.3.  Register Signed Statement

   This endpoint instructs a Transparency Service to register a Signed
   Statement on its log.  Since log implementations may take many
   seconds or longer to reach finality, this API provides an
   asynchronous mode that returns a locator that can be used to check
   the registration's status asynchronously.

   The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP request to
   register a Signed Statement:

   Request:

   POST /entries HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cbor
   Accept: application/cose
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   18([                            / COSE Sign1                                           /
     <<{
       / signature alg         / 1:  -35, # ES384
       / key identifier        / 4:   h'75726e3a...32636573',
       / cose sign1 type       / 16:  "application/example+cose",
       / payload-hash-alg      / 258: -16, # sha-256
       / preimage-content-type / 259: "application/spdx+json",
       / payload-location      / 260: "https://.../manifest.json"
     }>>,                          / Protected Header                                     /
     {},                           / Unprotected Header                                   /
     h'935b5a91...e18a588a',       / Payload, sha-256 digest of file stored at Location   /
     h'269cd68f4211dffc...0dcb29c' / Signature                                            /
   ])

   A Transparency Service depends on both the client's authentication
   context (if present) and the verification of the Signed Statement in
   the Registration Policy.

   The Registration Policy for the Transparency Service MUST be applied
   before any additional processing.  The details of Registration
   Policies are out of scope for this document.

   Response:

   One of the following:

2.1.3.1.  Status 201 - Registration is successful

   If the Transparency Service is able to produce a Receipt within a
   reasonable time, it MAY return it directly.

   Along with the receipt the Transparency Service MAY return a locator
   in the HTTP response Location header, provided the locator is a valid
   URL.

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: https://transparency.example/entries/67ed...befe
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   / cose-sign1 / 18([
     / protected   / <<{
       / key / 4 : "mxA4KiOkQFZ-dkLebSo3mLOEPR7rN8XtxkJe45xuyJk",
       / algorithm / 1 : -7,  # ES256
       / vds       / 395 : 1, # RFC9162 SHA-256
       / claims / 15 : {
         / issuer  / 1 : "https://blue.notary.example",
         / subject / 2 : "https://green.software.example/cli@v1.2.3",
       },
     }>>,
     / unprotected / {
       / proofs / 396 : {
         / inclusion / -1 : [
           <<[
             / size / 9, / leaf / 8,
             / inclusion path /
             h'7558a95f...e02e35d6'
           ]>>
         ],
       },
     },
     / payload     / null,
     / signature   / h'02d227ed...ccd3774f'
   ])

   The response contains the Receipt for the Signed Statement.  Fresh
   Receipts may be requested through the resource identified in the
   Location header.

2.1.3.2.  Status 303 - Registration is running

   In cases where the registration request is accepted but the
   Transparency Service is not able to produce a Receipt in a reasonable
   time, it MAY return a locator for the registration operation, as in
   this non-normative example:

   HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
   Location: https://transparency.example/entries/67ed...befe
   Content-Type: application/cose
   Content-Length: 0
   Retry-After: <seconds>

   The location MAY be temporary, and the service may not serve a
   relevant response at this Location after a reasonable delay.

   The Transparency Service MAY include a Retry-After header in the HTTP
   response to help with polling.

2.1.4.  Query Registration Status

   This endpoint lets a client query a Transparency Service for the
   registration status of a Signed Statement they have submitted
   earlier, and for which they have received a 303 or 302 - Registration
   is running response.

   Request:

   GET /entries/67ed...befe HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cbor
   Accept: application/cose
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Response:

   One of the following:

2.1.4.1.  Status 302 - Registration is running

   Registration requests MAY fail, in which case the Location MAY return
   an error when queried.

   If the client requests (GET) the location when the registration is
   still in progress, the TS MAY return a 302 Found, as in this non-
   normative example:

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://transparency.example/entries/67ed...befe
   Content-Type: application/cose
   Content-Length: 0
   Retry-After: <seconds>

   The location MAY be temporary, and the service may not serve a
   relevant response at this Location after a reasonable delay.

   The Transparency Service MAY include a Retry-After header in the HTTP
   response to help with polling.

2.1.4.2.  Status 200 - Asynchronous registration is successful

   Along with the receipt the Transparency Service MAY return a locator
   in the HTTP response Location header, provided the locator is a valid
   URL.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Location: https://transparency.example/entries/67ed...befe
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   / cose-sign1 / 18([
     / protected   / <<{
       / key / 4 : "mxA4KiOkQFZ-dkLebSo3mLOEPR7rN8XtxkJe45xuyJk",
       / algorithm / 1 : -7,  # ES256
       / vds       / 395 : 1, # RFC9162 SHA-256
       / claims / 15 : {
         / issuer  / 1 : "https://blue.notary.example",
         / subject / 2 : "https://green.software.example/cli@v1.2.3",
       },
     }>>,
     / unprotected / {
       / proofs / 396 : {
         / inclusion / -1 : [
           <<[
             / size / 9, / leaf / 8,
             / inclusion path /
             h'7558a95f...e02e35d6'
           ]>>
         ],
       },
     },
     / payload     / null,
     / signature   / h'02d227ed...ccd3774f'
   ])

   The response contains the Receipt for the Signed Statement.  Fresh
   Receipts may be requested through the resource identified in the
   Location header.

   As an example, a successful asynchronous follows the following
   sequence:

   Initial exchange:

   Client --- POST /entries (Signed Statement) --> TS
   Client <-- 303 Location: .../entries/tmp123 --- TS

   May happen zero or more times:

   Client --- GET .../entries/tmp123           --> TS
   Client <-- 302 Location: .../entries/tmp123 --- TS

   Finally:

   Client --- GET .../entries/tmp123           --> TS
   Client <-- 200 (Transparent Statement)      --- TS
              Location: .../entries/final123

2.1.4.3.  Status 400 - Invalid Client Request

   The following expected errors are defined.  Implementations MAY
   return other errors, so long as they are valid [RFC9290] objects.

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

   }

2.1.4.5.  Status 404 - Operation Not Found

   If no record of the specified running operation is found, the
   Transparency Service returns a 404 response.

   HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
   Content-Type: application/concise-problem-details+cbor

   {
     / title /         -1: \

     / detail /        -2: \
             "No running operation was found matching the requested ID"
   }

2.1.4.6.  Status 429 - Too Many Requests

   If a client is polling for an in-progress registration too frequently
   then the Transparency Service MAY, in addition to implementing rate
   limiting, return a 429 response:

   HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   Content-Type: application/concise-problem-details+cbor
   Retry-After: <seconds>

   {
     / title /         -1: \
             "Too Many Requests",
     / detail /        -2: \
             "Only <number> requests per <period> are allowed."
   }

2.1.5.  Resolve Receipt

   A TS may limit how often a new receipt can be issued, and respond
   with a 503 if a client requests new receipts too frequently.

   The following HTTP endpoints are optional to implement.

2.2.2.  Resolve Signed Statement

   This endpoint enables Transparency Service APIs to act like Artifact
   Repositories, and serve Signed Statements directly, instead of
   indirectly through Receipts.

   Request:

   GET /signed-statements/9e4f...688a HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cose

   Response:

   One of the following:

2.2.2.1.  Status 200 - Success

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   18([                            / COSE Sign1         /
     h'a1013822',                  / Protected Header   /
     {},                           / Unprotected Header /
     null,                         / Detached Payload   /
     h'269cd68f4211dffc...0dcb29c' / Signature          /
   ])

2.2.2.2.  Status 404 - Not Found

   The following expected errors are defined.  Implementations MAY
   return other errors, so long as they are valid [RFC9290] objects.

   HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
   Content-Type: application/concise-problem-details+cbor

   {
     / title /         -1: \
             "Not Found",
     / detail /        -2: \
             "No Signed Statement found with the specified ID"

2.2.2.3.  Eventual Consistency

   For all responses additional eventually consistent operation details
   MAY be present.  Support for eventually consistent Receipts is
   implementation specific, and out of scope for this specification.

2.2.3.  Exchange Receipt

   This endpoint is used to exchange old or expiring Receipts for fresh
   ones.

   The iat, exp and kid claims can change each time a Receipt is
   exchanged.

   This means that fresh Receipts can have more recent issued at times,
   further in the future expiration times, and be signed with new
   signature algorithms.

   Request:

   POST /exchange/receipt HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/cose
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   / cose-sign1 / 18([
     / protected   / <<{
       / key / 4 : "mxA4KiOkQFZ-dkLebSo3mLOEPR7rN8XtxkJe45xuyJk",

       / vds       / 395 : 1, # RFC9162 SHA-256
       / claims / 15 : {

         / subject / 2 : "https://green.software.example/cli@v1.2.3",
         / iat     / 6 : 1750683311 # Pre-refresh
       },
     }>>,
     / unprotected / {
       / proofs / 396 : {
         / inclusion / -1 : [
           <<[

             / inclusion path /
             h'7558a95f...e02e35d6'
           ]>>
         ],
       },
     },
     / payload     / null,
     / signature   / h'02d227ed...ccd3774f'
   ])

2.2.3.1.  Status 200

   A new Receipt:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Location: https://transparency.example/entries/67ed...befe
   Content-Type: application/cose

   Body (in CBOR diagnostic notation)

   / cose-sign1 / 18([
     / protected   / <<{
       / key / 4 : "mxA4KiOkQFZ-dkLebSo3mLOEPR7rN8XtxkJe45xuyJk",

       },
     }>>,
     / unprotected / {
       / proofs / 396 : {
         / inclusion / -1 : [
           <<[

             / inclusion path /
             h'7558a95f...e02e35d6'
           ]>>
         ],
       },
     },
     / payload     / null,
     / signature   / h'48f67a8b...b474bb3a'
   ])

2.2.4.  Resolve Issuer

   This endpoint is inspired by [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc].

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the
   Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://transparency.example/tenant/1234:

   Request:

   GET /.well-known/issuer/tenant/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Host: transparency.example
   Accept: application/json

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "issuer": "https://transparency.example/tenant/1234",
     "jwks": {
       "keys": [
         {
           "kid": "urn:ietf:params:oauth\

           "alg": "ES256",
           "use": "sig",
           "kty": "EC",
           "crv": "P-256",

         }
       ]
     }
   }

3.  Privacy Considerations

   TODO

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  General Scope

   This document describes the interoperable API for client calls to,
   and implementations of, a Transparency Service as specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture].  As such the security
   considerations in this section are concerned only with security
   considerations that are relevant at that implementation layer.  All
   questions of security of the related COSE formats, algorithm choices,
   cryptographic envelopes, verifiable data structures and the like are
   handled elsewhere and out of scope for this document.

4.2.  Applicable Environment

   SCITT is concerned with issues of cross-boundary supply-chain-wide
   data integrity and as such must assume a very wide range of
   deployment environments.  Thus, no assumptions can be made about the
   security of the computing environment in which any client
   implementation of this specification runs.

4.3.  User-host Authentication

   [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-architecture] defines 2 distinct roles that
   require authentication: Issuers who sign Statements, and Clients that
   submit API calls on behalf of Issuers.  While Issuer authentication
   and signing of Statements is very important for the trustworthiness
   of systems implementing the SCITT building blocks, it is out of scope
   of this document.  This document is only concerned with
   authentication of API clients.

   For those endpoints that require client authentication, Transparency
   Services MUST support at least one of the following options:

   *  HTTP Authorization header with a JWT

   *  domain-bound API key

   *  TLS client authentication

   Where authentication methods rely on long term secrets, both clients
   and Transparency Services implementing this specification SHOULD
   allow for the revocation and rolling of authentication secrets.

4.4.  Primary Threats

4.4.1.  In Scope

   The most serious threats to implementations on Transparency Services
   are ones that would cause the failure of their main promises, to wit:

   *  Threats to strong identification, for example representing the
      Statements from one issuer as those of another

   *  Threats to payload integrity, for example changing the contents of
      a Signed Statement before making it transparent

   *  Threats to non-equivocation, for example attacks that would enable
      the presentation or verification of divergent proofs for the same
      Statement payload

4.4.1.1.  Denial of Service Attacks

   While denial of service attacks are very hard to defend against
   completely, and Transparency Services are unlikely to be in the
   critical path of any safety-liable operation, any attack which could
   cause the _silent_ failure of Signed Statement registration, for
   example, should be considered in scope.

   In principle DoS attacks are easily mitigated by the client checking
   that the Transparency Service has registered any submitted Signed
   Statement and returned a Receipt.  Since verification of Receipts
   does not require the involvement of the Transparency Service DoS
   attacks are not a major issue.

   Clients to Transparency Services SHOULD ensure that Receipts are
   available for their registered Statements, either on a periodic or
   needs-must basis, depending on the use case.

   Beyond this, implementers of Transparency Services SHOULD implement
   general good practice around network attacks, flooding, rate limiting
   etc.

4.4.1.2.  Eavesdropping

   Since the purpose of this API is to ultimately put the message
   payloads on a Transparency Log there is limited risk to
   eavesdropping.  Nonetheless transparency may mean 'within a limited
   community' rather than 'in full public', so implementers MUST add
   protections against man-in-the-middle and network eavesdropping, such
   as TLS.

4.4.1.3.  Message Modification Attacks

   Modification attacks are mitigated by the use of the Issuer signature
   on the Signed Statement.

4.4.1.4.  Message Insertion Attacks

   Insertion attacks are mitigated by the use of the Issuer signature on
   the Signed Statement, therefore care must be taken in the protection
   of Issuer keys and credentials to avoid theft and impersonation.

   Transparency Services MAY also implement additional protections such
   as anomaly detection or rate limiting in order to mitigate the impact
   of any breach.

4.4.2.  Out of Scope

4.4.2.1.  Replay Attacks

   Replay attacks are not particularly concerning for SCITT or SCRAPI:
   Once a statement is made, it is intended to be immutable and non-
   repudiable, so making it twice should not lead to any particular
   issues.  There could be issues at the payload level (for instance,
   the statement "it is raining" may true when first submitted but not
   when replayed), but being payload-agnostic implementations of SCITT
   services cannot be required to worry about that.

   If the semantic content of the payload are time-dependent and
   susceptible to replay attacks in this way then timestamps MAY be
   added to the protected header signed by the Issuer.

4.4.2.2.  Message Deletion Attacks

   Once registered with a Transparency Service, Registered Signed
   Statements cannot be deleted.  Thus, any message deletion attack must
   occur prior to registration else it is indistinguishable from a man-
   in-the-middle or denial-of-service attack on this interface.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Well-Known URI for Transparency Configuration

   The following value is requested to be registered in the "Well-Known
   URIs" registry (using the template from [RFC8615]):

   URI suffix: transparency-configuration Change controller: IETF
   Specification document(s): RFCthis.  Related information: N/A

   TODO: Register them from here.
